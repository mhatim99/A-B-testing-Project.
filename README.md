# A-B-testing-Project.
This an A/B testing analysis for a company to decide which page design would bring more traffic conversion.
The testing analysis was made using Python, Pandas, MatplotLib and NumPy.
The project consisted of understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and helping the company understand through statistical conclusions, if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
